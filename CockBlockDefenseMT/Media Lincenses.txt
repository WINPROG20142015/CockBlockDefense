For the background music I went to http://ccmixter.org/, where I downloaded the song "Yes", by Elias May, under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license.

And for the sound effect I went to The Free Sound Project (http://www.freesound.org/), where I downloaded the sample "comic bite 2.wav" by ggctuk, under a Creative Commons sampling license.
