IV. GAMEPLAY

• Summary of Gameplay

The player must stop a set number of human enemies, from reaching the nest. 

This is accomplished by building and upgrading Chicken towers that shoot at, damage and kill the enemies before they are able to reach their objective. 

The enemies come in waves at set intervals. 

Each wave of enemies has different characteristics such as movement speed and health.

The player begins with a set number of lives, and loses one for each enemy that survives to reach its goal. 

The game will end early in defeat if the player′s lives reach zero, and it provides no way to regenerate lost lives. 

The game can be played in three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. There is also an endless mode.

• Goals of the Game

- The goal of game is to try to stop enemies from 

crossing a map by building Chicken towers which shoot 

at them with eggs as they pass. 

- Clear all the enemies in a wave to proceed to the next 

wave.

- Protect the nest at all cost. If the nest is destroyed, the 

game is over.

• Player control

-Mouse: mainly used for placing, buying, and upgrading towers. Can also be used to interact with the user interface or heads up display.
